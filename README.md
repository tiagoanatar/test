# Team Collaboration Project
## Front-end Product Engineer

First of all, thank you for working with us throughout this process! We know this is a substantial time commitment, and we’re striving to give you an as close as possible representation of what working in your role at FormAssembly will be like.

We also consider this a 2-way process. We expect you to evaluate us as much as we evaluate you, and in the end, we hope that you will be as excited about working with us, as we’ll be about you joining the team.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate how you can fulfill some of the core responsibilities of the Product Engineer, particularly concerning these areas:

-   Setting and communicating the technical direction.
-   Demonstrate your experience working with ReactJS, managing state and HTTP based APIs
-   Dealing with ambiguity and working effectively with a remote team.

We are interested in your process as much as the quality of your completed work.

Project Briefing
================

### Write a trivia game leveraging the [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php):

1. A game consist of 10 questions of which only one is displayed at a time, the player chooses difficulty and category. Capture the player name.
2. Support multiple choice and true/false questions
3. Add a score multiplier for consecutive correct answers
4. Generate a report upon completion and display the leaderboard for that category/difficulty
5. Leverage browser storage to maintain leaderboard score history so as to not wipe away results
6. Use ReactJS Hooks
7. Provides test coverage as you see necessary to ensure that the functionality you build will not be regressed by future work
8. Bonus points: display the answers at the end of the game, noting which ones were correct, which ones weren't.

### Guidelines:

- Please commit often, we are as interested in the result as we are in the way you got there, seeing your progress through the assignment is essential
- In order to avoid large commits with vendor directories that dwarf your code, please use a package manager, committing its files (or equivalent) but do not commit vendor directories (React, etc). Update this README.md file to explain how to pull in the dependencies.
- We suggest you use [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to scaffold your ReactJS app
- Feel free to use any open-source libraries
- Endeavor to deliver a complete solution that reflects your craftsmanship, attention to detail, testing strategy.
- Please submit your final solution to us via the GitHub repository we will provide.
- We’d like you to dedicate up to 12 hours to this project. Given the time constraints, we do not expect a comprehensive and accurate solution. We are more interested in the collaborative process, how you think about writing code, and how you can build a level of confidence in the code you write. The expectation is that you will submit an initial solution at 5 hours for peer code review. The remaining 7 hours will be spent addressing any feedback and refactoring/adding anything that you feel needs further work.
- Engage with us as you see fit. Product management, UI/UX, Quality & Product engineers will be available to you in the Slack channel
